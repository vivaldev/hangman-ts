# Hangman Game

## This is still a work in progress!

## Description

This is an exercise project for me to learn various things, such as Typescript, React always but useContext hook for the first time, using databases and many more. For now my "backend" database is just a data.ts file, but later on this will be a practice project for me to learn how to use a SQL database and how to connect it with the frontend. 

## How to run

The game is not yet finished and working, but if you still want to run it, you can do so by cloning the repository and running the following commands:

```bash
// clone the repository
gh repo clone vivaldev/hangman-ts
cd hangman-ts

// install dependencies
npm install

// run the app
npm run dev
```
